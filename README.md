## ✨ About the Project

**BuyMeABook** is a passion-driven web app inspired by *Buy Me a Coffee*, but with a literary twist.  
It allows users to:
- 🎯 Create a personalized **campaign** for a book they wish to read.
- 💌 Receive **support** or **contributions** through UPI or online payment.
- 📖 Encourage a culture of **gifted reading**  one book at a time.

The idea started as a small thought  *“What if someone could gift me the book I’ve been wanting to read?”*  
Now it’s real.
